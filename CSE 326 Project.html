<h1><center><b>Autodesk Maya Vs Cinema 4D</b></center></h1>
        <p><b>Maya</b> and <b>Cinema 4D</b>(C4D) are both used in the film industry.
         C4D is preferred for broadcast because the pace of graphics production is much faster in broadcast, so you 
         get good results quickly and short render times with C4D.
         Maya is a more complicated software, more complicated user interface and steeper learning curve.</p>
