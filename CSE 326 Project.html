<h1 style="color:red;"><center><b>Autodesk Maya Vs Cinema 4D</b></center></h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<hr>
        <p><b>Maya</b> and <b>Cinema 4D</b>(C4D) are both used in the film industry.
         C4D is preferred for broadcast because the pace of graphics production is much faster in broadcast, so you 
         get good results quickly and short render times with C4D.
         Maya is a more complicated software, more complicated user interface and steeper learning curve.</p><br>

<P>
When you look into 3D Software, it becomes clear that the purpose each tool serves makes 
them very different from one another. But when it comes to specific functions, you can realize that two pieces of
 Software can have very different approaches. Maya and Cinema 4D, which are two great modeling and animation 3D Software, 
illustrate this idea very well. 

Both are considered as standards by professionals, but not within the same industries.

<h3>What is Autodesk Maya</h3>
<hr>
<p>
Maya is a 3D simulation, modeling and animation software developed by Autodesk
 that has generated a lot of interest in the film and video games industries. This software gives access to tools that
 allow creating objects, animating them and generating visual effects. Its popularity is in part due to the high animation possibilities 
it offers, especially when it comes to bringing characters to life. Maya can be interesting for chara-design! Maya enables users to customize creations in-depth, 
and in part because of its unique programming language, MEL. Maya Embedded Language, can be used by professionals to code new tools and customized pipelines that
 will tie into the development needs of a project.
</p>
<h3>What is Cinema 4D</h3>
<hr>
<p>
Cinema 4D is a 3D modeling, animation, and rendering software developed by Maxon. As Maya, Cinema 4D
 can be used to animate objects or to generate visual effects, and is especially appealing because of its motion graphics features.
 This property helped Cinema 4D gain popularity in advertising and TV commercial production, 
yet, its ease of access also made it a nice fit for other fields, such as architecture visualization. 
</p>
<h2>Autodesk Maya Vs Cinema 4D</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Interface And Features</h3>
<p>
The accessibility of Software is to a large extent defined by the simplicity of its UI. 
And in that regard, Cinema 4D wins hands down.  Maya’s interface is hard to master (when it comes to modeling for instance),
 yet relies on powerful tools that will help you manage workflows in-depth. Indeed, Maya was one of the first to embed node-systems on which to base 
attributes and processes thanks to a feature called the Node Editor. Cinema 4D relies on a hand-on interface that many users prefer over other software for graphics, 
as it allows to achieve creations with a few buttons only. Cinema 4D’s usability is complemented by MOGRAPH, a powerful toolset that provides all the 
functionalities essential to motion graphics and allows to get projects done quicker. Within this same approach, Cinema 4D gives access to many preset objects and scenes, 
so that users can achieve concepts efficiently. 
</p>
<h3>Learning curve</h3>
<p>
Our previous point raises the accessibility of Cinema 4D and Maya.  As suggested previously, Cinema 4D was developed so as 
to appeal even to non-professionals. The preset materials and MOGRAPH together can help beginners take control of this Software and achieve
 good-looking concepts. This, by the way, is the reason why this program is appreciated for architectural visualization projects. Of course, 
Cinema 4D also contains its own set of complex features that do require a certain experience with the program. Complex models and plugins for
 rendering purposes, for instance, are amongst the elements one can expect to master only at an advanced level.  Maya, on the other hand, requires
 a certain knowledge of coding. First with the program’s own language, Maya Embedded Language, and also with Python. This learning is very rewarding 
as it unlocks, amongst others, the full-customization and animation potentials Maya has to offer. Yet, it also gives the program a steep learning curve.
</p>
<h3>Animation & Visual Effects</h3>
<p>
In terms of animation, Cinema 4D and Maya can achieve similar results. Note that Maya is preferred in the film and video games industry
 as this program is considered best for character rigging and animation. Visual effects do also account for a big share of these industries’
 work. Also, Maya’s MASH tool allows users to generate great visual effects quickly. Cinema 4D does also allow to generate awesome visual effects,
 yet, the program appeals to other professionals for this purpose. Cinema 4D is popular for its capabilities in motion graphics effects that can meet
 the tone and personality of a brand, or its products. Therefore, Cinema 4D is well appreciated for TV commercial and advertising creation. 
</p>
<h2>Cinema 4D and Maya: Which one will you go for?</h2>
<p>
To make your final decision, first take into account your knowledge of 3D software and the goal you would like to pursue with this purchase.
 If you haven’t touched any modeling or animation software beforehand and want to take quick control over your program, Maya may not be for you. 
This product requires a great learning effort and could possibly discourage you. This is the reason why schools make a point of teaching this software, 
which students can freely use for three years, thanks to Autodesk.

Now, if you want to move to either of these programs for specific professional goals, identify what your needs will be. 
As we saw previously, Cinema 4D and Maya’s functionalities tend to overlap, yet, the former is mostly used for short-film and 
TV commercial creation, while the latter is considered standard in the film and video game industries. 

As a consequence, big size studios may require candidates to know how to use Maya, and in that regards, learning it would make sense. 
However, note that even though Cinema 4D has limitations in video game creation for instance, it is absolutely possible to use this Software for such purpose.
