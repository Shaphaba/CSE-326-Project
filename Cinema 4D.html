            <b>Cinema 4D</b> is a professional 3D modeling, animation, simulation and rendering software solution. 
            Its a fast, powerful, flexible and stable toolset make 3D workflows more accessible and efficient for design, 
            motion graphics, VFX, AR/MR/VR, game development and all types of visualization professionals. Cinema 4D produces 
            stunning results, whether working on your own or in a team.<br>
            2014 saw the release of <b>Cinema 4D Lite</b>, which came packaged with Adobe After Effects Creative Cloud 2014.
            "Lite" acts as an introductory version, with many features withheld. 
            This is part of a partnership between the two companies, where a Maxon-produced plug-in,
            called Cineware, allows any variant to create a seamless workflow with After Effects.
            The "Lite" variant is dependent on After Effects CC, needing the latter application running to launch, and is 
            only sold as a package component included with AE CS through Adobe.
            Initially, Cinema 4D was developed for Amiga computers in the early 1990s, and the first
            three versions of the program were available exclusively for that platform. With v4, however, Maxon began to 
            develop the application for Windows and Macintosh computers as well, citing the wish to reach a wider audience and
            the growing instability of the Amiga market following Commodore's bankruptcy.
            On Linux, Cinema 4D is available as a commandline rendering version.

        <h2><b>Modules and older variants</b></h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
From R12 to R20, Cinema 4D was available in four variants. A core Cinema 4D 'Prime' application, 
a 'Broadcast' version with additional motion-graphics features, 'Visualize,' which adds functions for architectural design and 'Studio,'
which includes all modules.<br>

From Release 8 until Release 11.5, Cinema 4D had a modular approach to the application, with the ability to expand upon the core application with various modules. 
This ended with Release 12, though the functionality of these modules remains in the different flavors of Cinema 4D (Prime, Broadcast, Visualize, Studio)
          <pre>
                The modules are:
                
                  * Advanced Render (global illumination/HDRI, caustics, ambient occlusion and sky simulation)
                  * BodyPaint 3D (direct painting on UVW meshes; now included in the core. 
                    In essence Cinema 4D Core/Prime and the BodyPaint 3D products are identical. 
                    The only difference between the two is the splash screen that is shown at startup and the default user interface.)
                  * Dynamics (for simulating soft body and rigid body dynamics)
                  * Hair (simulates hair, fur, grass, etc.)
                  * MOCCA (character animation and cloth simulation)
                  * MoGraph (Motion Graphics procedural modelling and animation toolset)
                  * NET Render (to render animations over a TCP/IP network in render farms)
                  * PyroCluster (simulation of smoke and fire effects)
                  * Prime (the core application)
                  * Broadcast (adds MoGraph2)
                  * Visualize (adds Virtual Walkthrough, Advanced Render, Sky, Sketch and Toon, data exchange, camera matching)
                  * Studio (the complete package)
