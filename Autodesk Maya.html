            Maya is professional 3D software for creating realistic characters and blockbuster-worthy effects.
            Bring believable characters to life with engaging animation tools.
            Shape 3D objects and scenes with intuitive modeling tools.
            Create realistic effects—from explosions to cloth simulation.<br>
            The software was initially released for the IRIX operating system. 
            However, this support was discontinued in August 2006 after the release of version 6.5. 
            Maya was available in both "Complete" and "Unlimited" editions until August 2008, 
            when it was turned into a single suite.<br>
            Users define a virtual workspace (scene) to implement and edit media of a particular project. 
            Scenes can be saved in a variety of formats, the default being .mb (Maya D). 
            Maya exposes a node graph architecture. Scene elements are node-based, each node having its own attributes 
            and customization. As a result, the visual representation of a scene is based entirely on a network of 
            interconnecting nodes, depending on each other's information. For the convenience of viewing these networks, 
            there is a dependency and a directed acyclic graph.
            Nowadays, the 3D models can imported to game engines such as Unreal Engine and Unity.

        <h3>Industry Usage</h3>
<hr>
        <p>
            Maya is used by top feature film animation studios like Blue Sky Studios, Framestore,
            Moving Picture Company, and Industrial Light & Magic. Many of your favorite studios use Maya as a critical piece 
            of their production pipeline, from rigging and modeling, all the way through to character animation.<br>
            The widespread use of Maya in the film industry is usually associated with its development on the 
            film Dinosaur, released by Disney and The Secret Lab on May 19, 2000. 
            In 2003, when the company received an Academy Award for Technical Achievement, it was noted to be used in films 
            such as The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, Spider-Man (2002), Ice Age, and Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones.
            By 2015, VentureBeat Magazine stated that all ten films in consideration for the Best 
            Visual Effects Academy Award had used Autodesk Maya and that it had been "used on every winning film since 1997."
